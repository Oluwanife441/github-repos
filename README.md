# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite and react.
Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Additional

Subject: Explanation for Collaborative Work and Delayed Submission

-- Firstly, I want to clarify that I collaborated with a fellow learner and also got help from online resources in completing the code. Due to my ongoing preparation for the JAMB (Joint Admission Matriculation Board) examination, I faced time constraints that hindered my ability to fully prepare for the current examination independently.

-- To address this, I intend to utilize the upcoming one-week break to diligently cover any missed material and ensure that I am fully prepared for subsequent assessments.

-- Furthermore, I recently concluded my JAMB examination on Saturday, April 20, 2024. The timing of my submission, today, April 22, 2024, coincides with the completion of this important examination milestone.

-- Should you require any further information or clarification regarding this matter, please do not hesitate to contact me via email at [orimoloyeoluwanufemi@gmail.com].

Thank you for your understanding and consideration.

Sincerely,
[Orimoloye Nifemi]
